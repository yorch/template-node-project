# Template NodeJS Project

[![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=yorch/template-node-project)](https://dependabot.com)

This is a bootstrap template for NodeJS projects that will run directly on NodeJS v10+.

It uses Babel v7 to support the latest JS features.

Also has basic Docker setup, so you can easily deploy your project to any Docker compatible server using Docker Compose.

Some examples that you can use this template for are:

-   Web Server using ExpressJS.

-   A worker that runs tasks on a schedule basis using packages as [`node-schedule`](https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule).

## TODO

-   Improve documentation
-   Consider adding a build tool like RollUp or Webpack
